> Where we launch things that go places



## General Installation

You're going to need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
```bash
brew install node
```

We use yarn, not npm, because its good.
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Then you're going to want to install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the Firebase toolset
```bash
yarn global add yo firebase-tools
```

Then you can totally install this thing right from GitHub since it aint on NPM yet

```bash
yarn global add https://github.com/upgrowth/generator-canaveral
```

mkdir project-name
cd project-name
yo canaveral
